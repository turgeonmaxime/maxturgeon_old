I am an assistant professor in Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Manitoba. My main research interests are dimension reduction methods for high-dimensional data. This includes linear approaches (e.g. PCA, CCA, PCEV, PLS) as well as nonlinear approaches (e.g. manifold learning, autoencoders). I am interested in developing statistical methodologies that are statistically and computationally efficient. I am also interested in applications to statistical genetics, genomics, and neuroimaging.
